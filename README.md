# Class project - Java Ball Game
### A simple game, coded in Java and drawn with Swing
As a part of my event-driven programming classes I had to create a simple game using Java (it was also my first time using the language). This is the result of that assignment.

The game's objective is to get the falling ball (light blue circle) to the portal (white-blue circle) while avoiding walls and collecting various powerups and stars. The player controls the ball using arrow keys.
